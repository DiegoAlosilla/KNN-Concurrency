K Nearest Neighbour is a simple algorithm that stores all the available cases and classifies the new data or case based on a similarity measure. It is mostly used to classifies a data point based on how its neighbours are classified.
Letâ€™s take below wine example. Two chemical components called Rutime and Myricetin. Consider a measurement of Rutine vs Myricetin level with two data points, Red and White wines. They have tested and where then fall on that graph based on how much Rutine and how much Myricetin chemical content present in the wines.
